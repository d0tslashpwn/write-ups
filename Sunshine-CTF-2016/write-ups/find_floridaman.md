summary: "Write-up about Sunshine CTF 2016 - Find Floridaman"
---

To find the flag of this challenge, we need to look at Florida based newspaper and search in the comments. The hint we have is to look a story about a man accused of throwing a live alligator through a restaurant's drive-through window.

After some research, we find that the newspaper we need to look at is [The Palm Beach Post / MyPalmBeachPost](http://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/) and the article we needed to read was [_Wendyâ€™s alligator-thrower is only fulfilling his Flori-duh destiny_](http://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/news/news/crime-law/wendys-alligator-thrower-is-only-fulfilling-his-fl/nqNfr/). The flag is in the comments.
